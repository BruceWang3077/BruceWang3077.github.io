# Intro

I'm a Master student of Computer Science at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/) in Stony Brook, NY. Before SBU, I graduated from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China in 2023, where I got my BE degree in Computer Science and Technology. <br/><br/>

I'm passionate about **full-stack development**, **distributed systems**, and **machine learning**. Over the years, I've completed several full-stack projects alongside my academic journey. During my Master's study, I have the honor to work as a research assistant under Professor Shuai Mu, where I get a deeper look into the exciting world of distributed systems.<br/><br/>

During My undergrad years, I broadened my horizons through study abroad programs, including VISP program of [University of Wisconsin, Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), and School of Engineering 3+2 program of [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/). I appreciate the insights and cultural exchange these great programs brought me. From a proud **<span style="color:#C5050C">Badger</span>**, an **<span style="color:#255799">Anteater</span>**, to now a **<span style="color:#990000">Seawolf</span>**, I love them all!<br/><br/>

In my spare time, I am committed to personal growth. I enjoy learning about humanity and society, always aiming to improve myself both mentally and physically. Currently, I'm practicing a morning routine inspired by various books and podcasts, starting with waking up at 6 amâ€”if you have similar goals, experiences, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out. I believe that open communication and shared experiences can benefit us all.<br/><br/>


<!-- I am the co-founder and CTO of [Promptfoo](https://promptfoo.dev), where we're building open-source tools to evaluate, find, and fix vulnerabilities in LLMs. Before Promptfoo, I was the VP of Engineering at [SmileID](https://www.usesmileid.com), where I led the development of tools that have helped over 170 million people in Africa gain access to financial services. I also co-founded [Arthena](https://arthena.com) and [Matroid](https://matroid.com).

In my spare time, I enjoy investing in people and ideas through a [small venture fund](https://skepticalinvestments.biz), focusing on projects with high social impact. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause, or if you're interested in collaborating, feel free to get in touch. -->

# My Journey
- During the first 13 years of my life, I was a "part-time" student and a "full-time" piano artist specialized in classical music. Classical music was my entire world, filling my days outside the classroom.
- At the age of 12, I held my **solo piano concert**, a milestone that shaped my early years.
- I had the honor to get instructions from [Dr.Hong Xu](https://music.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/hong-xu). He's a world-class pianist, who earned his Doctor of Musical Arts from the Juilliard School in Manhattan. His success in the U.S. was a significant influence, sparking my own dream of pursuing education in the United States for the first time
- I pivoted from musical art to regular school education due to an arm injury(Don't worry, I'm okay now).
- I fell in love with physics because of the great movie **Interstellar**. After watching the movie I read *A Brief History of Time*, and many other books about physics. Because of which I also developed an affection with sci-fi novels. My favorite is *The Three Body Problem*. At that time, I made up my mind to get a degree in physics after going to college.
- With near-zero prior knowledge about computers, I took a course about Java programming in my freshman year. Surpirsingly, I became obssesed with it immediately.<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="/images/prettyDamnGood.jpg" alt="Alt text" width="300">
</div>Solving algorithmic challenges and the elegance of coding solutions felt like playing video games to me. I declared my major as Computer Science right after that semester. 
- And the rest is history.



<!-- - My parents put a computer in my bedroom in 1993 when I was 3. It was an old Tandy that ran MS-DOS. My favorite games were Street Rod 2, Wolfenstein 3D, and Tom and Jerry. It had a mechanical keyboard and a turbo button. To this day, I still don't know what pressing the turbo button really did.
- We subscribed to AOL in 1995. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk onto our brand-new Packard Bell. It took years for me to send my first email.
- In the summer of 1996, my uncle purchased [MegaRace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaRace) from [Media Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Play) and installed it on my mom's work computer. I might have endangered her business by using her computer too much.
- At 7, I discovered the mini-games hidden in Microsoft Office. I also beat Minesweeper on expert for the first time.
- At 8, my parents bought me a Sony Mavica MVC-FD71 digital camera after I stole their SLR one too many times. It could fit 10 images to a floppy disk at a 0.3MP resolution. I still have it, and it still works. I've been taking photographs ever since, now with a Nikon D750, D800, and occasionally with a Mamiya 6II.
- At 10, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage on our Pentium III [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc.). My website was terrible.
- I was 11 when I built my first [Tesla Coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil) (without my parents' permission). Over the next few years, I built several more, including one of the first audio modulated coils and one of the first DRSSTCs.
- When I was 12, I set the all-time high record at my local laser tag facility by reverse engineering the charging station and weapon protocols with a photo-resistor, micro-cassette recorder, and a lot of patience. I was unstoppable.
- At 13, I went to space camp and fell in love. I went back two more times and promised myself that I'd work in space. I've since helped build three generations of satellites and have contributed to two more.
- At 14, I was almost expelled for finding a backdoor into my high school's file server and telling everyone but the faculty members about it. Later that year, I figured out how to turn off the internet firewall by editing system registry keys. I anonymously shared my work months later.
- At 16, I participated in a foreign exchange program in Dortmund, Germany. Since then, I've gone back almost every year.
- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter-Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Halo 2, and Age of Empires II.
- At 18, in the summer before college, my friends and I started playing [Muggle Quidditch](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(sport)>). We went on to start over 8 teams in the [International Quidditch Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Quidditch_Association), including the [Buffalo Quidditch Society](https://www.facebook.com/buffaloquidditch/). At our height, we were ranked third in the IQA. Although I don't play anymore, you can still see pictures of me holding a broom while wearing a chess camp t-shirt on Facebook.
- At 19, I took my first graduate course and published my first academic paper.
- At 20, I co-authored a grant to build a satellite and managed a 60+ person team for the next two years. You can read more about that [here](https://ubnl.space/glados/).
